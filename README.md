## Description

This project allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can sign up, search for books, save favorites for future reference, and delete them from their saved list as needed. Each book's entry displays its title, author, description, image, and a link to purchase it, accessible by clicking on the book's image. The project is built using React for the user interface, with MongoDB as the database, and GraphQL and Apollo for querying and managing persistent data.
